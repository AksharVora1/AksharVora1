Project URL: https://hlljqgh09k5ga987-54868475987.shopifypreview.com

TASK DETAILS:-

1. Would it be possible within each product description box to change the heading/tab name? For example, if I wanted to change "SPECIFICATION" to "DIMENSIONS" And the system could also pull the heading of that section from the tab name?? ==> Done (for more detail please check  in video how it'll work).

2. With the specifications section, can we wrap a border around the <ul> just want to make it look like a table? Also just wondering if we can have a header row on the table also? ==> Done (Attached Screenshot)

3. When I removed the VIDEOS section it kinda broke... I think we would definitely need the ability to remove sections, mainly the documents and the video, but sometimes there might be videos but no documents? How could that work? : Done (for more detail please check  in video how it'll work).

4. Mobile looks great the only call out is that the word "specification" looks pushed to the right, I am assuming you something like a 30px padding on the <a> tag? Maybe just center the text? ==> Done (Attached Screenshot).

Tsak Detail:

    ==> on sequence button click made condition function for intro audio

        ==> for example when we load the site and playing the audio at that time intro audio will play but after then audio is playing 6th sentence then user pause the audio and replay that at that time it will play from paused sentence so intro will not play each time.

        ==> condition tested and not conflicted with another functionality.

    ==> Created Next step function 

        ==> for this functionality made condition for audio and progressbar 

        ==> one more condition created in this function it will check audio play or pause if audio is playing first time or on first step it should to wait to hear intro video.

    ==> Created Previous step function
